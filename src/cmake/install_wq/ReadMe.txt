    Fortran Library : "DELWAQ" Project Overview
========================================================================

The Deltares can-do-everything Wizard has created this

	"DELWAQ" 

install project for you as a starting point.

This file contains a summary of DELWAQ project.

DELWAQ is the engine of the D-Water Quality and D-Ecology programmes of 
the Delft3D suite. It is based on a rich library from which relevant 
substances and processes can be selected to quickly put water and 
sediment quality models together.

The processes library covers many aspects of water quality and ecology, 
from basic tracers, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, organic matter, 
inorganic suspended matter, heavy metals, bacteria and organic 
micro-pollutants, to complex algae and macrophyte dynamics. High 
performance solvers enable the simulation of long periods, often 
required to capture the full cycles of the processes being modelled.

The finite volume approach underlying DELWAQ allows it to be coupled to 
both the structured grid hydrodynamics of the current Delft3D-FLOW 
engine and the upcoming D-Flow Flexible Mesh engine (1D-2D-3D) of the 
Delft3D Flexible Mesh Suite (or even other models such as TELEMAC).

'DELWAQ in open source' is our invitation to all leading experts to 
collaborate in further development and research in the field of water 
quality, ecology and morphology using Delft3D. Feel free to post your 
DELWAQ related questions or comments in this dedicated forum space. 
If you are new to DELWAQ, the tutorial (in the user manual) is a good 
place to start.
